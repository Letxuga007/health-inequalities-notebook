This project is a collection of information and knowledge related to analytical work on "Health Inequalities", as performed in the NHS and the wider UK Health and Social Care sector.


The aim of the project is to collect together information that is helpful and relevant to analysts doing work in this space. By doing this, the project will:

1.  Become a "Body of Knowledge", and a quick reference for analysts.

2.  Share ideas and approaches which analysts can use in their own work, lowering the barrier to entry into this work, and encouraging broader and deeper analytical participation for the benefit of patients.

3.  Share public examples of previous work, to support conversations with stakeholders during the specification stage of a health inequalities project.

4.  Foster open-source collaboration in an area of public benefit, in line with reccommendations from the [Goldacre Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis#modern-open-working-methods-for-nhs-data-analysis), and the [NHS Digital Sevice Manual](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/standards-and-technology/service-standard-points/12-make-new-source-code-open).

## Who is the audience?

The scope is very large, and analysts working in this space come from different types of organisation. For example:

-   Provider trusts. Analysts with good access to patient-level data who can use their analyses to provide practical descision-support to people directly running services that patients use.

-   ICBs. Analysts with less access to patient-level data, but with access to information from multiple organisations in a region, and with more context about regional populations, links to public health orgs, and local government.

-   NHS "centre". Analysts from NHS Regions or NHS England who work with government on broad health inequalities intervention planning (eg. those working on the [Core20PLUS5](https://www.england.nhs.uk/about/equality/equality-hub/national-healthcare-inequalities-improvement-programme/core20plus5/) programme).

The project is organic, and will be taken in the direction that contributors (with some steering from maintainers) choose. For example, if the majority of contributors are from provider trusts, it can be expected that the depth of information relevant to ICBs might be less deep.

**This is a call to action for contributors to involve themselves in the project! Please get involved if you work in this space, can see a gap, or want to steer the direction of this project.**

## Related projects

This project has a "sister" project, which is a code repository of R code and functions of interest to analysts actively working on data. It is also at an early stage, and there is an open call for contributors. Please get involved if you can. You can find links to both sister projects here:
